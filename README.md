## Angular Best Security Practices

1. **Sanitize User Input**
   - Always sanitize user inputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Use Angular's built-in sanitization functions or libraries.

2. **Use Angular’s Built-in Security Features**
   - Utilize Angular's built-in security mechanisms such as the DomSanitizer service to handle potentially unsafe values.

3. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Configure Content Security Policy headers to restrict the sources from which content can be loaded, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

4. **Avoid Using `innerHTML`**
   - Refrain from using `innerHTML` for rendering HTML content. Instead, use Angular’s template binding and Angular's security features to handle dynamic content.

5. **Use Angular’s HttpClient for Secure Communication**
   - Ensure secure communication between the client and server by using Angular's HttpClient with proper HTTP methods and headers.

6. **Protect Routes with Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement route guards to protect routes and ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to access specific parts of your application.
