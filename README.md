## 1. Enable Content Security Policy (CSP)

CSP is a security measure that helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks by defining which resources are allowed to be loaded by the browser.

- **Example:** Configure a CSP that allows only trusted sources (e.g., your own domain or trusted CDNs).
- **Implementation:**
  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;">
